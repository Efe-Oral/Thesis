- [X] Get other information of the gameobject, not just its name e.g. Transfor, rotation values etc.
- [X] Add an open source text to 3D asset/model generator model (rn only img to 3d implemented) (https://github.com/YanWenKun/Hunyuan3D-2-WinPortable?tab=readme-ov-file)
   |- dependincies: CUDA v12.4 install only CUDA>>Runtime>>Libraries and CUDA>>Dev>>Complier; vs_BuildTools. You need to add these to path via environment variable check with cl and nvcc --version
- [X] In cursor, find a way to auto accept the performed tasks from MCP (Agent>Pencil Symbol>Auto-run activate)
- [X] Make STT a package and add easily (use elevenlabs API key)
- [X] Merge MCP-testing branch to main

- [] Give STT output to cursor, to use MCP tools with speech
- [] Add new MCP tools

- [] Print the name of the gameobject that is being looked at as a floating label UI
   |- [] Integrate TTS and STT from unity praktikum to use MCP with speech in cursor

- [] Add undo action for modified assets in game
