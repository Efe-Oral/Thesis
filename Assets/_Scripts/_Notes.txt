- [X] Print the name of the gameobject that is being looked at on the console
- [X] Create outline shader around the selected object
- [X] When you look at an object, just print its name to the console once, not continuasly
- [X] Get other information of the gameobject, not just its name e.g. Transfor, rotation values etc.
- [X] Add an open source text to 3D asset/model generator model (rn only img to 3d implemented) (https://github.com/YanWenKun/Hunyuan3D-2-WinPortable?tab=readme-ov-file)
   |- dependincies: CUDA v12.4 install only CUDA>>Runtime>>Libraries and CUDA>>Dev>>Complier; vs_BuildTools. You need to add these to path via environment variable check with cl and nvcc --version
- [X] In cursor, find a way to auto accept the performed tasks from MCP (Agent>Pencil Symbol>Auto-run activate)
- [X] Make STT a package and add easily (use elevenlabs API key)
- [X] Merge MCP-testing branch to main
- [X] Find a way to add MCP server packages to github repo, hence the end prodcut package
- [X] Print the name of the gameobject that is being looked at as a floating label UI


- [] Give STT output to cursor, to use MCP tools with speech
- [] Create a CUSTOM  MCP tool for communication with unity (voice_command_tool.py) [https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp/blob/0351e4fcf4288a23db4dbe71b863c6c4124acf10/HOW_TO_ADD_A_TOOL.md]
   |DESIGN CHOICE: unity writes to a .txt file and cursor reads OR unity sends the request via POST request

- [] Find a way to press enter in inspector mode to test MCP Voice command tool and send the text to the .txt file



- [] Solve ERROR: Port 6400 is already in use (issue #103). Temp. soulution is change the port number is the following scripts: UnityMcpBridge.cs; UnityMcpEditorWindow.cs; config.py
- [] Add a new MCP toolset for unity, see if you can use it with exisitng mcp tools

- [] Add undo action for modified assets in game
- [] Make Hunyuan3D asset generator work in API modes with text prompts, not just img inputs
   | Check this text to 3d model creation repo, write its owner (https://github.com/Scriptwonder/Unity-Text2Model)

- [] Combine the scripts: BezierCurve, Callout and LazyFollow into 1 FloatingUI script
- [] Find a way to save the changes in gameplay mode, so when it returns to scene mode, the changes stay
- [] Read papers
